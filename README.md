# Proxy API Challenge

This repository contains a dual-component system designed to interact with one of Semeqâ€™s internal staging APIs. It offers:

- **Backend**: A REST API built using **FastAPI**, responsible for authentication and data forwarding.
- **Frontend**: A terminal user interface (TUI) built using **Textual**, providing a user-friendly CLI for interacting with the backend.
